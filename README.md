First Software I have ever build. This ICS Generator is a stand alone Software written in Javascript, HTML and CSS to create an *.ics file with one or more events.

To install the Software, you can use a webserver you want to.

I use Ubuntu 22.04 with the following commands:

apt update && apt upgrade
apt install apache2 git
git clone https://github.com/Schello805/icsgenerator.git

open the IP of the Webserver
